## Loading and preprocessing the data

First we'll load the `activity.csv` data.  I downloaded it to my
`~/Downloads` directory, so we'll load it from there and then convert
the `date` column to dates with `as.Date`.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("~/Downloads/activity.csv")
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Let's see a histogram of total steps per day (ignoring `NA`s):

```{r}
with(data,hist(steps,col="red"))
```

The mean and median steps per day are as follows (again, ignoring
`NA`s):

```{r}
list(mean=mean(data$steps,na.rm=TRUE),median=median(data$steps,na.rm=TRUE))
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

For the average daily activity pattern, we want to average the number
of steps over all days for each 5-minute interval, then graph a
timeseries of that.

The only complication is that for the plot we want now want to convert
the intervals (which are integers in the format `%H%M`) to regular times.

```{r}
averagedSteps <- tapply(data$steps,data$interval,mean,na.rm=TRUE)

times <- strptime(sprintf("%04d",as.integer(dimnames(averagedSteps)[[1]])),format="%H%M")

plot(times,averagedSteps,type="l",xlab="",ylab="Steps",main="Steps Averaged Over 5-Minute Intervals",col="blue",lwd=3,tck=1)
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
